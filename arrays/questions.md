1. Move Zeroes to the end of the array

Description:
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.


2. Remove Duplicates from a sorted array and return the length of new array

Description:
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
For example, Given input array nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

3. Compute the intersection of two arrays and make sure that elements in result set are unique.

Description:
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].
Note:
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.

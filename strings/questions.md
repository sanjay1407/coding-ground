1. Determine if two given strings are valid anagrams

Description: Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.
Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

2. Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
Examples: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true. pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false. pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false. pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false. Notes: You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

3. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11. 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21. 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211. Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

4. Design an algorithm to print all permutations of a string. For simplicity, assume all characters are unique.

5. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the orig- inal string, your method should return the original string.
